# Codsoft-Internship-task-3
 my latest project on Iris Species Prediction as part of my internship at Codsoft!"  I developed a machine learning model that predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. I implemented Logistic Regression model and compared its performance with other classifier like Decision trees and K-Nearest Neighbour.
